Prepare a file with info about yout mysql and mongo databases.
For mysql a user with FLUSH privileges is needed:

        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "user": "root",
        "password": "foobar",
        "port": "3309"
    }],
    "mongo": {
        "dbname": "edxapp",
        "host": "localhost",
        "user": "edxapp",
        "password": "secret",
        "port": "27017"
    }
}
```

Save the file and point edxdump to it:

    docker run \
        --network host \
        -v /path/to/dump/destination:/destination \
        -v /path/to/config/file.json:/etc/edxbackup.json \
